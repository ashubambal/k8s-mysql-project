## Kubernetes MySQL Deployment (k8s-mysql-project)
This repository contains Kubernetes manifests to deploy a MySQL database in a Kubernetes cluster. This example demonstrates how to set up a MySQL deployment with configuration values stored in ConfigMaps and sensitive data like passwords stored in Secrets.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

A running Kubernetes cluster.
kubectl CLI tool configured to connect to your cluster.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to deploy MySQL in your Kubernetes cluster:

1. Clone the Repository
	git clone https://github.com/your-username/k8s-mysql-project.git
	cd k8s-mysql-project

2. Create a Namespace
	kubectl create namespace mysql

3. Create a ConfigMap for MySQL Configuration
Edit mysql-configmap.yaml to define your MySQL configuration settings:

	apiVersion: v1
	kind: ConfigMap
	metadata:
	  name: my-configmap
	data:
	  MYSQL_DATABASE: your_database_name

Apply the ConfigMap:
	kubectl apply -f mysql-configmap.yaml


4. Create a Secret for MySQL Root Password
Edit mysql-secret.yaml to set your MySQL root password:

	apiVersion: v1
	kind: Secret
	metadata:
	  name: my-secret
	type: Opaque
	data:
	  MYSQL_PASSWORD: base64_encoded_password_here


Apply the Secret:

	kubectl apply -f mysql-secret.yaml

Make sure to replace base64_encoded_password_here with the base64-encoded value of your MySQL root password.

5. Deploy the MySQL Database
Apply the MySQL Deployment:
	kubectl apply -f mysql-deployment.yaml


6. Accessing MySQL
You can access the MySQL database from within the Kubernetes cluster using the MySQL client or by exposing it externally using a Service and LoadBalancer or NodePort, depending on your requirements.

7. Cleaning Up
To delete the MySQL deployment and associated resources, run:
	kubectl delete namespace mysql

Additional Configuration
You can further customize the MySQL deployment by editing the mysql-deployment.yaml file as needed.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during deployment or need further assistance, please refer to the Kubernetes documentation or seek help from the Kubernetes community.

Disclaimer
This is a basic example intended for educational purposes. In a production environment, you should follow best practices for security, data persistence, and scalability.
